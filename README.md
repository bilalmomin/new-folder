PROJECTS 
•	Project Title: Used Bike Price Predictor (https://bike-price.herokuapp.com/)
Organisation: Learning purpose
Platform Used: Python, HTML, CSS
Contribution: Completely built by me.
Description: The aim of the project is to build a web app that will predict the price of the used bike based on the conditions like bike model, location, distance driven, year etc. The project includes the steps like data collection by web scraping, data cleaning and pre-processing, data analysis, model building, optimising the model and deployment on Heroku (PaaS). It also includes the use of Census data to convert the data in required format. The webpage content is build using HTML5 and CSS bootstrap.

•	Project Title: Speaker Normalization Using Machine Learning
Organisation: Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology
Platform Used: Python
Contribution: Analysis and Coding
Description: In this project we have learned and implemented the concepts of Signal processing and Machine Learning using Python. Libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scipy and other visualization libraries are used. Four speakers from Arctic database was used to create the training and validation datasets. The main aim behind the project was to showcase that the inter-speaker variance is lesser as compared to inter-speech variance which was obtained by building a model using Autoencoder.
•	Project Title: Smart Vehicle System
Organisation: ATS Leaning Solutions
Platform Used: Raspberry Pi and Python
Contribution: Hardware implementation and Coding
Description: The main aim behind this project was to build a Smart Vehicle System to ensure safe parking of cars and maintain the security of the vehicle when parked using the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Use of different sensors such as Proximity sensor, IR sensor etc were implemented on the car surface. The Raspberry Pi 3 module was installed on the car which was programmed to monitor the activities and notify the owner through an application called Blynk.
